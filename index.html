  <div class='collection-text'> This is where it all starts.
   <br> <br> This is my data collection in its rawest form. Our first assignment in ENGL 3844, we were tasked with picking a subject that we engage with frequently, and simply marking down how many times we interact with it in a one-week period. As you can see, I chose how often I engaged with the website ESPN.com, and being a beat reporter for the football team the week of a home game, there was no shortage of engagements. Scroll through the spreadsheet to see what I was checking out throughout the week leading up to the game. </br> </br>

      <div class="my-svg-text">
      <p2>This svg allowed me to highlight what kinds of teams/article types that I was reading about during a week that I was going to cover the Virginia Tech vs. Old Dominion football game. My marks and attributes highlight these things through sheer quantity as well as through size and shape to demonstrate how focused I was on certain parts of the research compared to others. I am able to see what days I was more concentrated on learning and preparing, and what kinds of information and on which team I was learning about each day.</p2>

  	<div class="explained-text"> This video allowed me to take my data collection and new SVG and apply that to the larger theme of psychographics. Psychographics is a deeper version of demographics, as I have learned. It is more in-depth and peers into your personality; your likes, dislikes, preferences, etc. to create a profile about the type of person you are. This is especially useful for marketing practices or agencies that are interested in catering their media towards a specific market.
